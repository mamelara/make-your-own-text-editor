# Make Your Own Text Editor
Instructions on how to make your own text editor based off of a guide located
[here](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html). 

The guide is an good example of building a project from scratch and also about
design choices. Each commit will have an explanation of the lines of code added
though for a more full explanation it is best to follow the guide itself.
